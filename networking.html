        <h3>Getting your foot in the door<br>
        07.23.18</h3>
        <p>Every job opportunity starts with a first step. But when you are unsure how or where to move, this could
        really stall your job search or stir you in the wrong direction. Here are some simple ideas on how to
        make that first step.</p>
        <p><strong>Reaching out to people</strong><br>
            We’ve all heard it, and we all know how important networking is to land a dream job. The first step when thinking about your network is to look at your immediate circle of family and friends. They might know someone at “x” company or they are doing what you would like to be doing. If your immediate network is not strong enough (maybe they don’t know anyone in the industry that you would like to work in) then your next step should be to look at your school’s Alumni. This a huge network that you can tap and that has something already in common with you. And,if that does not work, get creative! I landed a great internship by volunteering at a local non-profit and speaking to another one of the volunteers. While networking can be daunting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2018/04/23/10-networking-tips-to-help-you-make-a-great-first-impression-at-an-event/#359bd347301b">here</a> are some tips to get better at it.</p>
        <p><strong>Career Fairs</strong><br>
            Even if you have been out of school for a couple of years or you have not yet graduated, career
            fairs can be the best way to get your resume to a recruiter at the company that you like or the
            industry that you are interested in. It might be that they do not have an opening right now, but
            having your resume on file is extremely important as your information will be in their pipeline.</p>

          <p><strong>Saying “yes” to different opportunities</strong><br>
          When I talk to students who are looking for a full-time job, they are often disappointed to hear how many years of experience companies ask for entry-level positions. In a lot of industries and companies, they use internships to build their pipeline. So before you say no to an internship after graduation, this might actually be a great idea to get your foot in the door and prove yourself in a 3-month period. The worst case scenario is you get more experience under your belt and best case scenario it leads to that full-time role that you wanted.</p>
          <p><strong>Informational Interviews</strong><br>
          Last but not least, is being open to talking to people. There are a lot of professionals who would be willing to sit down for a coffee if you approach it is a learning opportunity. Sometimes learning more about the job is the best way to land one. It also gives you an opportunity to ask and learn more about the company without the full pressure of feeling like you are interviewing. Additionally, it helps build a relationship with someone that can turn into a potential mentor or an advocate in the future.</p>
          <p>Networking can give you immediate results, but it’s more about making a <a href="https://hbr.org/2007/01/how-leaders-create-and-use-networks">long-time investment</a> in your career. Even if you are not looking for a job right now, you should never stop networking. The truth is, we live in a relationship-based world, and you never know who could be your next employer or your next employee.
