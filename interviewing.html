        <h3>The art and the science of it<br />

        <p>Preparing for an interview takes more time than just googling the company and skimming their website. Interviewing is a process that requires time and preparation, before, during and after the interview. Here are some simple tips and tricks that will help you stand out.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fully research the company beyond their website. Researching the company website is a great first step, but this only tells you half the story. To get a better picture of where you are interviewing you should also see if you can find any news report related to them – to see what the industry is saying about them, challenges they are currently experiencing and success stories.</li>
            <li>Try to get a sense of who they are and what the culture is like by looking at their social media channels. This way you can see what their tone is and how corporate or not they are. It also highlights what it is important for them to put out there. For example, if they are highlighting anniversaries it means that people stay there for a long time and they are proud of that. Additionally, you should check out their Glassdoor page. This can give you insights on the actual day-to-day of working there. Just be cautious about reviews because remember, people only write reviews when they are extremely happy or upset, so you should use it as a reference but not take it as the die hard truth.</li>
            <li>Learn about the industry. Especially if you want to get into the industry the best way to do so is by learning what the people actually do. In communications for example, advertising, marketing and public relations are similar but not the same. If you are interviewing for a Public Relations role and you are passionate about product placement in stores then you are better suited for a Marketing role. It might seem simple but knowing what people actually do there and why you are a fit for it is the easiest step and the best way to show that you are prepared.</li>
            <li>Get all in the information that you can on the interview team. Search their LinkedIn profiles and get a sense of what their career path has been and how they got to where they are. These could be really great talking points for when you are in front of them.</li>
            <li>Make sure you arrive on time, but not too early. Say hi to everyone you encounter and be polite. Your interview starts once you set foot in the building. Additionally, when waiting in the lobby do not be on your phone. This is the best time to be looking around and seeing how everyone talks to each other and how they interact. Use it as a learning opportunity.</li>
            <li>During the interview try to answer the question that is be asked. You would be amazed how people sometimes answer everything except the question that is being asked. One of the best qualities a candidate can have is being able to listen attentively. If you want to expand on your answer first pause and ask the interviewer if it’s okay for you to go into further detail. On the other hand, try to give substance to your answers. They already read your resume so what can you tell them that is not there, or better yet, how can you provide an example to make your answer stronger.</li>
            <li>After the interview always send a thank you note to everyone that you met and try to make it personal. People like to be thanked for their time and this will keep you top of mind.</li>
        </ol>
            <p class="space">There is no exact science to the art of interviewing. Interviewing is a like constructing a relationship. You don’t have to be anyone except yourself. If the opportunity is meant to be for you then it will be, and if it doesn’t work out, try to understand that it might not be about you but about the role. Either way, you never know when the right opportunity might pop up after and making a great impression will keep the door open forever.</p>
